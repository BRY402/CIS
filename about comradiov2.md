# About comradiov2.

comradiov2 AKA comradio is a way of communicating (other than global chat) between servers in a ROBLOX game currently known as Void script builder / Oxcool1's script builder.
> How do i use it?

About that i recommend read this [documentation about the protocol,](https://github.com/fofl12/comradio/blob/main/comradio2.md) here are some things you can do with comradio:
- Rosters
- Pings
- Messaging
- Status changing
- Channels
- Nicknames

And, in case you didn't understand fofl12's documentation, i made a wrapper for it that you can check out [here](/comradiov2 wrapper.lua) i can't really explain how it works because i'm not a teacher.
  You can also use these commands:
  ```
  Connection:Roster()
  Connection:Chat()
  Connection:SetStatus()
  Connection:SetChannel()
  Connection:SetNickname()
  ```
